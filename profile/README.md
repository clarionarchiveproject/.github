# Welcome to the Clarion Archive Project

This organization is dedicated to preserving the tools, knowledge, and community contributions related to the Clarion programming language, from its early CPD days through Clarion 11 and beyond.

We host open repositories that contain:
- Historical Clarion software and documentation
- Tools, utilities, and source code
- Community contributions
- Metadata, timelines, and research

We believe Clarion's legacy deserves to be preserved, documented, and made accessible for future generations of developers, researchers, and software historians.
